# filesearch
This code searches for duplicate files in given directories and produces a csv file with a list them.
It does not delete or move any files. Therefore, the user has to do the duplicate removal herself manually.

I used the tkinter library to build a graphical user interface for the code. Then, I used the PyInstaller library
to build executable files for Mac and Windows.

The code is availabe at https://github.com/california-19/filesearch. The program does not collect any information
as well. It was just a side project for me.

I may or may not improve the visuals later on. It serves its purpose but I am not planning to turn this into a full-fledged
program that does everything automatically. There are many options for a program like that and I do not see a point to
produce another one. 

I highly appreciate your feedback. Thank you in advance.
